/**
 * a field is a nonzero commutative division ring, or equivalently a ring whose nonzero elements
 *  form an commutative group under multiplication.
 * @author Trevor Decker
 *
 * A feild is closed under addition and multiplication 
 * A feild is assositive for addition and multiplication a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c and a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c.
 * A feild is communitive for addition and multiplication a + b = b + a and a · b = b · a.
 * A feild has additve and multiplicate inverses 
 * A feild allows for distribution of multiplication over addition 
 * A feild has additive and multplicate identy elements
